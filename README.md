# Udacity FEND - Classic Arcade Game Clone
This project is a game app I built as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

## How To Run The Game
* Download this repository
* Open the `index.html` file in your web browser  

## How The Game Works
In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs).

The goal of the player is to:
* Collect the key (+2 points)
* Make it to the glowing portal without colliding into any enemies
* Collect as many gems as possible to increase your score!

The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. When the player collides with an enemy, the "level" is reset, the player loses a life as well as any gems/points collected, and is moved back to the start square.

The game ends once the player loses all three of their lives.

Other features:
* Choose your player's avatar!
* A restart button to start a completely new game
